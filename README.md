# Final Project
- Nelson Wapon Safo, Sonika Garg and Taylor Kline

- Running this project works like the given instructions:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	./bin/skinning ../assets/pmd/[model of your choice] 

The project runs like Project4 and Project5 for now but does not render models but only L-system trees
